  Code discription
  -
    the main motto of this code is to find entropy, info, and gain. In this code, we load data set using the pandas library. Create a bin on 'TotalSales' (Quantity * UnitPrice) column which is added at loading time. After that Overall entropy is calculated using this formula:-
            Entropy(D)=-âˆ‘p(xi) log P(xi)
     like this Country-wise entropy is calculated. After that net entropy (Info) is calculated using this formula:- Info(D)=|D1|/|D|Entropy(D1)+...+|Dn|/|D|Entropy(Dn)
    then gain is calculated using this formula:- gain(D new)=(E init) - (E new)
